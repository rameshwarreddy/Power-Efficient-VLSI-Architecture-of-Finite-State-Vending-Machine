# Power-Efficient-VLSI-Architecture-of-Finite-State-Vending-Machine
This project presents a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** based **Vending Machine Controller** designed using **power-efficient VLSI techniques**. The design is implemented at the RTL level using **Verilog/VHDL**, focusing on **area, timing, and power optimization** during synthesis.
